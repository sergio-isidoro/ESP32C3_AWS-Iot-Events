# Automated Control System with AWS IoT Events Integration

This project implements an automated control system that integrates the ESP32 with AWS IoT Events for real-time event detection, device monitoring, and automated actions. It uses AWS IoT Core, SNS for notifications, and IoT Events for seamless event management based on sensor data.

## üåü **Features**

- **AWS IoT Integration:** Connects ESP32 with AWS IoT Core for secure communication and data handling.
- **IoT Events Detection:** Monitors IoT device states and triggers events based on conditions like location changes or system malfunctions.
- **Automated Notifications:** Sends real-time alerts via Amazon SNS when specific events are detected.
  
### **Device State Monitoring**

- Monitors device location and temperature.
- Detects state changes (e.g., entering or leaving a predefined area).
  
### **Automated Event Handling**

- Automatically triggers actions like sending notifications or activating other AWS services.

## üìö **Code Overview**

- **Setup Phase:** Initializes Wi-Fi and MQTT connection to AWS IoT, including device certificates for secure communication.
  
### **Loop Functions**

- **Event Monitoring:** Checks for button presses and updates device state (e.g., temperature changes).
- **MQTT Communication:** Publishes sensor data to AWS IoT Core and subscribes to device shadow updates.
- **AWS IoT Events Integration:** Sends events to AWS IoT Events when specific conditions (e.g., location change) are met.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Sends email alerts via Amazon SNS when certain events are triggered.

## üöÄ **How to Use**

1. **Initial Setup:** Connect the ESP32 to your Wi-Fi and configure AWS IoT Core credentials.
2. **Device Registration:** Register your device in AWS IoT Core and configure policies and certificates.
3. **Event Configuration:** Use AWS IoT Events to define event detection logic and configure automatic actions.
4. **Operation:** Monitor device states and receive notifications in real-time when events occur.
5. **Testing:** Test the setup by pressing the button to simulate temperature changes or state transitions.

## üéØ **Applications**

This system can be adapted for various IoT applications such as:

- **Automated asset monitoring:** Track devices and trigger actions based on specific states (e.g., low battery, location change).
- **Smart alerts:** Set up real-time alerts for system malfunctions or state changes.
- **Industrial IoT solutions:** Manage and monitor devices in a factory or warehouse environment.
